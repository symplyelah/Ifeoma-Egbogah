# I Trust Only God; Everyone Else Must Bring Data

I recently came across a quote that says, *"I trust only God; every other person needs to bring data."* On the surface, it sounded like a cheeky quip, but beneath it lied a profound truth—especially in a world where trust is often misplaced, and relationships can be emotionally and mentally costly.

Let’s explore what this quote could mean from both a faith-based and analytical point of view. As someone who believes in God, I understand that divine trust is absolute. But with people, trust must be earned—and ideally, measured.

# Friendship Isn't Random—It's Data-Driven

We often say we *“vibe”* with someone or just *“click,”* but that click is more than magic—it’s measurable. Whether consciously or not, we evaluate others based on specific variables or criteria. These may not be written down in a spreadsheet (although… maybe they should be?), but they guide our decisions nonetheless.

Let’s look at some of the data points we use—often subconsciously—when choosing friends:

## Shared Beliefs and Values (Binary: Yes/No)

Do we believe in the same core things? It could be faith, integrity, or just a shared view of life.

> **Data Point:** Do we go to the same church? Do we value honesty? 
>
>**Scoring:** 1 (Yes), 0 (No)

## Level of Kindness (Scale: 0–10)

Is this person empathetic? How do they treat others—especially when no one's watching?

> **Observation-Based Rating:** How do they respond to someone in need?
>
> **Scoring:** From 0 (heartless) to 10 (exceptionally kind)

## Emotional Intelligence or Maturity (Scale: 0–10)

Can they hold space for your feelings? Do they handle conflict well or blow up over minor issues?

> **Indicators:** How do they resolve misunderstandings?
>
> **Scoring:** From 0 (emotionally volatile) to 10 (emotionally grounded)

## Supportiveness (Scale: 0–10)

Are they present when it counts? Do they clap when you win, and stand by when you’re struggling?

> **Scoring**: Based on consistency over time

## Mutual Benefit (Qualitative + Quantitative)

Is the relationship one-sided or mutually nourishing?

> **Assessment:** Do you both give and receive emotional, spiritual, or intellectual support?

# Analyzing the Data: The “Friendship Scorecard”

We don't need to turn relationships into science experiments, but it helps to be intentional. Think of your mind as running a mental "Friendship Scorecard"—not to judge, but to guard your heart.

> *“Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”*— Proverbs 4:23

By using soft data—behavior patterns, consistency, shared experiences—we can make wiser decisions about whom we allow into our inner circle.

# ⚠️ A Word of Grace and Caution

While using “data” is empowering, we must also remain gracious and flexible. People grow. Circumstances change. Someone who once scored a 4 in maturity may develop into a 9 over time.

We are all evolving, learning, and maturing—and the same grace we hope others extend to us, we must be willing to extend to them.

So while we analyze, we must also stay open to redemption, second chances, and personal growth. Every data point is a snapshot, not a full biography.

# Final Thoughts: Faith + Data = Discernment

Trusting God fully doesn't mean living carelessly. On the contrary, it gives us a model for discernment. And discernment is simply spiritual data analysis. You pray, observe, test the fruit, and decide.

So yes, trust God completely. For everyone else? Bring the data. Let your friendships be intentional, evidence-based, and spiritually aligned.

# Have You Checked Your Inner Circle Lately?

Who would score high on your friendship metrics? 
Who needs re-evaluation? 
Maybe it’s time for a personal audit.
