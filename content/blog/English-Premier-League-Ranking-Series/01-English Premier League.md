## The Premier League

---

The __Football Association Premier League Limited__, commonly known as the *Premier League*, represents the top tier of the men's football league system in England. Comprising 20 clubs, the league follows a promotion and relegation system in conjunction with the *English Football League (EFL)*. The typical season spans from August to May, during which each team plays 38 matches against all other teams, both at home and away. While most games take place on weekends, primarily Saturday and Sunday afternoons, some weekday evening fixtures are also scheduled. 

Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: __Manchester United__ (13), __Manchester City__ (6), __Chelsea__ (5), __Arsenal__ (3), __Blackburn Rovers__ (1), __Leicester City__ (1) and __Liverpool__ (1)
