## The Premier League

---

The __Football Association Premier League Limited__, commonly known as the *Premier League*, represents the top tier of the men's football league system in England. Comprising 20 clubs, the league follows a promotion and relegation system in conjunction with the *English Football League (EFL)*. The typical season spans from August to May, during which each team plays 38 matches against all other teams, both at home and away. While most games take place on weekends, primarily Saturday and Sunday afternoons, some weekday evening fixtures are also scheduled. Three points are awarded to the winning team, a point for a draw and no point for a loss for each march played.

Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: __Manchester United__ (13), __Manchester City__ (6), __Chelsea__ (5), __Arsenal__ (3), __Blackburn Rovers__ (1), __Leicester City__ (1) and __Liverpool__ (1)


## Managers

Every club in the league is overseen by a manager who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the team. This includes tasks such as selecting players for each match, acquiring new players, and overseeing training.

*Arsene Wenger*, who managed Arsenal from 1996 until the end of the 2017-18 season, is the longest-serving manager in the league's history. During his tenure, he managed a total of 828 matches, all with Arsenal. *Alex Ferguson*, who managed Manchester United from the league's inception in 1992 until his retirement in the 2010-13 season, holds the record for second-most matches managed in the league with a total of 810 matches.

It is worth noting that, to date, no manager from England has succeeded in winning the Premier League.
