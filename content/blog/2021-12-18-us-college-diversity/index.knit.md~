##Tidy Tuesday: US College Diversity Data
The Tidy Tuesday challenge for week 11, 2020 was on US College tuition, diversity and pay. As diversity in higher institution is such an important topic, I was curious about which schools by location were the most diverse, I decided to plot a density dot map. 

A dot density map is a type of Thematic map that uses large numbers of dots or points to portray the relative geographic distribution of a population of some kind (e.g., people, livestock, businesses)
