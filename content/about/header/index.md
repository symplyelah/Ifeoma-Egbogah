<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an epidemiologist by training, a Nigerian food exporter and an independent data visualization storyteller with skills in statistical analysis and data visualization. 

I am always improving my skills in design  by contributing to challenges such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/symplyelah/Tidytuesday) and self-led personal projects.

My favorite tool for data analysis is [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), an open source statistical computing and graphics software. For data visualization i use the package [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) from the [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package and many more.
